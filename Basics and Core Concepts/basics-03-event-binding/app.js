// Summary of Methods, Computed, and Watchers in Vue.js

// Methods:
// - Functions that can be called within the template or other methods.
// - When to Use:
//   - Triggering user actions (e.g., button clicks).
//   - Operations that need parameters.
//   - Logic that does not need to be cached.
// - Example Use Case: Form submission, dynamic calculations.


// Computed Properties:
// - Properties that return a value derived from reactive data.
// - When to Use:
//   - Data transformation that should be cached.
//   - Complex bindings in templates.
// - Example Use Case: Displaying a full name, derived state from other data.


// Watchers:
// - Functions that watch specific properties and run code when they change.
// - When to Use:
//   - Asynchronous operations (e.g., API calls).
//   - Performing side effects on data change.
//   - Precise control over reactions to data changes.
// - Example Use Case: Reacting to search input, API calls on data change.
